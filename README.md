# reactCRUD

### CRUD OPERATIONS ON REACT
--> We can create, retrieve, update, delete EMPLOYEE LIST.
--> There is a Search bar for finding Employee
--> Each Employee has id, title(Name) 

We will build a basic Employee Management Application using React JS with CRUD features:
Create Employee
List Employee
Update Employee
Delete Employee
View Employee
